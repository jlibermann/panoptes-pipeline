# PIAA Notebooks

This folder contains a number of jupyter notebooks that are used in various ways, either to explore the data or to help generate assets (e.g. figures for papers).

The notebooks are organized into subfolders depending on their functionality or what aspects of the system they involve.

### Assets

* **[Superpixels-And-Stamps](assets/Superpixels-And-Stamps.ipynb):** Generates an image of the superpixl as an example to be used in papers, etc.
