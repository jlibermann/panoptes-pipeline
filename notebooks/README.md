# PIAA Notebooks

This folder contains a number of jupyter notebooks that are used in various ways, either to explore the data or to help generate assets (e.g. figures for papers).

The notebooks are organized into subfolders depending on their functionality or what aspects of the system they involve.

### Assets

* **[Superpixels-And-Stamps](assets/Superpixels-And-Stamps.ipynb):** Generates an image of the superpixl as an example to be used in papers, etc.

* **[Observing-Run-Stats-and-FOV-Plot](assets/Observing-Run-Stats-and-FOV-Plot.ipynb):**  Aggregates the total number of images and exposure time for each sequence that has more than 30 minutes of exposure time. Also plots the FOV for all sequences. Meant to be informative but probably not exact. Also generates a latex table with same information.
